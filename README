Notes on design:
  As of the time of writing this, DHTPlay uses three threads of control at any
given time. The first is the main thread of control that is started by the
python interpreter which enters a gtk main loop after doing a bit of
initialization. The second is a thread that is bootstrapped by the main thread
that I call the 'server wrangler'. This thread polls the server sockets and 
notifies the server threads when they have received new packets. It also
spawns the new server threads that are created for each DHT server. There is
also a thread that is used for dispatching queries to the SQLite Database.
Some of the methods of this thread are for syncronous access and some are for
async access. This thread is used because sqlite connections cannot be shared
across threads and because I wasn't interested in making an implimentation that
used locks. In order for the server threads/server wrangler thread to
communicate with the gui thread the glib.idle_add function is used. When the
GUI thread needs to communicate with the server thread a special udp message
is sent to the server.

To recap - Threads:
  1 Main Thread (GTK/GDK ui thread (can be locked using gtk.gdk.lock))
  1 Server Wrangler thread (polls file descriptors to check for packets)
  1 SQLite Thread (holds sqlite cursor and connection, has query functions)
  x DHT Server threads (one for each server)

Documents that this program aims to impliment:
  BEP_0005 (DHT Protocol): http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html
  BEP_0033 (DHT Scrapes): http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0033.html
  "Minor Extensions to the Bitorrent DHT": http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/bittorrent/bep-dht-minor-extensions.html
  The undocumented 'v' version extension that uTorrent and rTorrent impliment in addition to other clients. Note: there is a bit about the version key here - http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/dht_extensions.html
